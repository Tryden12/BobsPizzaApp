# BobsPizzaApp
This app is a simple pizza ordering app I built to better understand the fundamentals of Kotlin. 

It's an app which is built for a fictional pizza company "Bob's Round and Flat Pizza." 

# Usage
The user can.. 
  * Login, Create a user, or continue as a guest
  * Change preferences such as background and text size
  * View the menu
  * Customize and place an order to his or her choosing
  * View the total updated dynamically on the order screen

Once an order is placed, a text file is updated for historical purposes.
